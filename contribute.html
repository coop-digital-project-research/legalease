        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

        <p>LG Electronics Inc. (“LGE” or “we”) is committed to protecting the information of those individuals and groups who use LG Smart TV Services. This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use, and share information that we obtain as a result of your use of these services and, in particular, sets out:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What information LGE may obtain from you or your LG Smart TV;</li>

          <li>How LGE uses the information that it obtains;</li>

          <li>When LGE shares information with others; and</li>

          <li>How you may control LGE’s use and sharing of your information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>LGE’s Smart TV Services provide access to “apps” and links to other services owned and operated by third parties, such as content providers like Netflix and YouTube. These third party services are outside the scope of this Privacy Policy and have their own policies that apply to the collection, use, and sharing of information in connection with their services. We encourage you to read those policies. LGE is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices of such third parties.</p>

        <h2>What information does LGE obtain?</h2>

        <p>When you first set up your LG Smart TV, you will be prompted to enter certain information, such as the country where the LG Smart TV is being set up and your zip code or postcode. This is to enable us to configure your LG Smart TV so that it displays the appropriate services and content for your region.</p>

        <p>When your LG Smart TV is connected to the Internet, during the set-up process and thereafter, we will receive certain information, including Device Information, that is needed to authenticate and set up your LG Smart TV, as well as power its basic functions. This information is necessary for the basic functioning of the Smart TV and does not require agreement with this Privacy Policy. However, in order to gain access to the full range of Smart TV services, you must agree to our Privacy Policy, which facilitates a greater exchange of information between your LG Smart TV and our systems.</p>

        <p>The information that we may receive when you use your LG Smart TV falls into the following categories:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Device Information. This refers to information collected about your LG Smart TV and certain related devices, such as your set-top box, remote control, and DVD or Blu-ray player. Device Information may include information to authenticate your LG Smart TV with our servers, the country code and zip code or postcode of the region where your LG Smart TV is being set up, your IP Address, device type (e.g., set-top box, DVD player, etc.), MAC address (or in some circumstances, a truncated MAC address), software platform version, language, set-top box manufacturer, screen resolution, and model number.</li>
          <li>Viewing Information. This refers to information about your interactions with program content, including live TV content, movies, and video on demand. Viewing Information may include the name of the channel or program watched, requests to view content, details of actions taken while viewing (e.g., play, stop, pause, etc.), the duration that content was watched, and input method (RF, Component, HDMI).</li>
          <li>Basic Usage Information. This refers to information which records your interactions within the LG Smart TV, such as the menu items you click on, the apps you access (but not your activity within apps), what channels are available to you, and information regarding external devices connected to the Smart TV.</li>
          <li>Voice Information. This refers to voice commands and associated data (such as information about the input device that records your voice) used to recognize and act upon the command, OS information, TV model information, content provider, channel information and service results.</li>

          <p>As well as receiving the above information directly from your LG Smart TV, LGE may receive further information that you choose to provide in order to access certain LG Smart TV Services. For example, some of our services require that you become a member of LG Content Store, which may be subject to separate terms. You may join LG Content Store either through your LG Smart TV or by other means, such as through certain LG websites. This Membership Information may include your user ID, password, telephone number, name, date of birth, gender, email address, address, social networking service ID, security question answers, purchase history, and related payment information, such as credit card information or details of your PayPal account and more.</p>

          <p>Device Information, Viewing Information, Basic Usage Information and Voice Information are generally handled by LGE in such a way that members of your household are not identified or identifiable from that information, so such information is not “personal information.” If you become a member of LG Content Store and are logged-in to LG Content Store when you use LG Smart TV Services, however, then certain Device Information, Basic Usage Information, Viewing Information, and Voice Information may be associated with your Membership Information in such a way that it may become personally identifiable to you.</p>

          <h2>How will LGE use the information it obtains?</h2>

          <p>We use information obtained from your LG Smart TV (both non-personal information and, where applicable, personal information) for various purposes, including:</p>
